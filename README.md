# React Chatbot

A modular, React-based chatbot application designed to demonstrate clean component architecture, predictable state management, and scalable response handling. This project serves as a foundation for building rule-based or extensible chatbot systems using modern React practices.

---

## Overview

This chatbot application focuses on:

* Clear separation of concerns between UI, logic, and data
* Reusable and composable React components
* Structured chatbot responses using objects instead of raw strings
* A scalable architecture suitable for future expansion (API integration, AI models, global state)

The project is intentionally kept framework-light to make the core React concepts easy to understand and extend.

---

## Features

* Interactive chat interface
* Structured chatbot response objects
* Component-driven UI design
* Predictable one-way data flow
* Easy extension for new intents or response types

---

## Tech Stack

* **React** (Functional Components)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **CSS** (or your chosen styling approach)

```

This structure reflects a clear separation between UI components, reusable hooks, assets, and application entry points, making the codebase easy to navigate and extend.

## Chatbot Response Design

Chatbot responses are structured as objects to allow flexibility and future growth.

Example:

```js
const botResponse = {
  hello: "Hello! How can I help you?",
  whatIsToday: "Today is {currentDate}",
  data: {}
}
```

This approach makes it easy to:

* Add new response types
* Attach metadata or payloads
* Separate UI rendering from business logic

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-chatbot.git
cd react-chatbot
npm install
```

### Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on your local development server.

## Extending the Chatbot

You can extend this project by:

* Adding new chatbot intents and response handlers
* Connecting to an external API or AI service
* Introducing global state management (Context API or state libraries)
* Persisting chat history

---

## Learning Goals

This project is intended to reinforce:

* Core React concepts
* Prop-driven component design
* State lifting and shared data patterns
* Clean and maintainable frontend architecture
